## Hi there, I'm Jakob Edvardsson 👋

I'm a computer science student at Malmö University, who loves tinkering with computers and software!
If I'm not writing code I'll be cosplaying as a Sysadmin in my homelab.
I'm currently pursuing a bachelor in Computer Science with specialization in Computer Systems Development.
